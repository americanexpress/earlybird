EarlyBird is a sensitive data detection tool capable of scanning source code repositories for clear text password violations, PII, outdated cryptography methods, key files and more. It can be used to scan remote git repositories, local files or directories or as a pre-commit step.

## Installation
### Linux & Mac
Running the `build.sh` script will produce a binary for each OS, while the `install.sh` script will install Earlybird on your system. This will create a `.go-earlybird` directory in your home directory with all the configuration files. Finally installing `go-earlybird` as an executable in `/usr/local/bin/`.
```
./build.sh && ./install.sh
```

### Windows
Running `build.bat` will produce your binaries while the `install.bat` script will create a 'go-earlybird' directory in `C:\Users\[my user]\App Data\`, and copy the required configurations there.  This script will also install `go-earlybird.exe` as an executable in the App Data directory (which should be in your path).

```
build.bat && install.bat
```

## Usage
To launch a basic EarlyBird scan against a directory:
```
$ go-earlybird --path=/path/to/directory
```
```
$ go-earlybird.exe --path=C:\path\to\directory
```
or to scan a remote git repo:
```
$ go-earlybird --git=https://github.com/americanexpress/earlybird
```
